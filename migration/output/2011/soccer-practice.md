Well, we signed the kids up for Soccer at the local Y. August played last fall and Elizabeth didn't want to, but this year she's in. We split them up, so they're not on the same team. We thought that would be best considering Elizabeth's ability to be a bull in a china shop.

In preparation for the season starting, I had them out in the front yard tonight after dinner kicking a ball around. Before long a couple of neighbor kids came over and we had a full yard, 3 to 7 year old game of keep-away going. I won.
