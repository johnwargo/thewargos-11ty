I'm wrapping up what is my 17th Lotusphere conference. This has been a big event for me, lots of good things and some not so good things happened here.

I've made a whole bunch of friends here, won a couple of IBM awards here, even met my wife here (kissed her first time here too). Had my most consecutive nights of heavy drinking here, probably had my most consecutive hangovers here too. Probably the most consecutive nights of least hours of sleep here too.

I'm probably one of the only people in the world to meet and marry a booth babe by being here.

This is where I was when I found out that my mother passed away.

I've been a presenter here many times. Gotten lots of good compliments here.

Can't wait to take the kids to Disney (here). Not sure if I'll try to speak here again next year.
