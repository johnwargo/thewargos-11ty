The  funniest thing about last night was me chasing my neighbor Liz up her  driveway with a squirt gun. It's a STEEP hill and, although I knew she  was a runner, I thought that since she was a girl (and I had Soccer  legs) that I could catch her. Nope, no way. I got a certain distance  behind her and couldn't get any closer to her as we ran. Unfortunately,  she was just far enough away and we were both running fast enough that I  could barely spray her.

I got her later, she was hiding from my neighbor Jeff behind a bush - of  course, I snuck up behind her around the other side of the bush and  dumped a bucket on her. Too much fun.
