I've always had pet names for the twins. We started out calling them by their given names although we struggled for the first couple of weeks saying ‘August.’ Over time I started mixing in different names for them, to the point where the kids really aren’t sure what we’re going to call them.

In general, I started calling August G-Man – in an effort to educate him that some people will ultimately call him Gus (although we don’t, my brother does).  I call him Dude a lot too.

Because of the whole g-man thing, I started calling Elizabeth E-girl. It seemed to make sense. Over time we have called her a bunch of other things: doodle bug, bug, punkin’ and more.  My brother? He calls her Spike – I’m not quite sure why (nor am I sure that he knows why).

Anyway, the other morning I was having some trouble getting out of bed. I was just lazing around trying to find a reason to not get out of bed. Elizabeth came up and we spent some time talking. August came up later and for some reason I called him punkin.’ He immediately reminded me that punkin’ was Elizabeth and he was g-man. He immediately Tooted (what Anna calls farting) so I decided that for that day, his name was going to be g-stink instead of g-man. August thought that was mightily funny and it became part of our banter for the remainder of the week.

Don’t let the g-stink get ya!
