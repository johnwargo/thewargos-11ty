I was able to move into my new, what to call it, outbuilding a few weeks ago. The builder finished most of the work, only a few little things left over and a couple of big things (such as my book shelves and the air conditioning unit in my workshop. I've been so busy lately that I didn't get a chance to give you some updated photos, so I thought I'd post some close to finished pictures for you to see. The landscaping is finished and the office should be done in a few weeks (once I get the book shelves installed and filled).Â  Here's what it looked like a few weeks ago. Enjoy!
