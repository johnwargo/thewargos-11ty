The kids are crazy about Duct Tape - they're constantly asking to get the roll out of my workshop to use for something. August is so proud of the fact that he knows how to say it right - It's not Duck Tape, it's Duct Tape, used to seal Ductwork in your house. I'm probably going to buy each of them they're own roll - separate colors with specific instructions about what and what cannot be duct taped.
