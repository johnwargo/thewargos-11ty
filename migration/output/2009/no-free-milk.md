We took the kids to their new school yesterday for open house. When we got home, Anna told me an interesting story I thought I'd share.

The school offers free lunch for the students. We looked at the menu and saw that while they had some healthy food, most of the stuff was fried or very fatty (chicken nuggets, peperoni pizza and so on). Anna's probably going to pack a lunch for the twins and one of the things we learned last night was that if you eat the free lunch the school provides, Milk is included. If you pack your own lunch, you have to pay for the Milk. It's all or nothing - how rediculous is that?
