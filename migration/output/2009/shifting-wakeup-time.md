The twins are starting Kindergarten in a few weeks, so Anna and I have been trying to shift their bed time to accommodate. August is a late sleeper, and we've rarely woken him up. Now, with early morning school - he's going to have to start getting up at a regular time. It's not going very well - Elizabeth is doing OK, she's been an early riser all along, but August is trying to be a trooper in the morning, but fades at the end of the day and ends up being pretty fragile by bed time. Hopefully he will be all recovered by the time school starts.
