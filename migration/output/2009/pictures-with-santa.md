We stopped by a local nursery on Sunday to pick up our yearly Christmas wreath and some poinsettias. It also happened to be the same day that Santa stopped by to have some pictures taken with the kids. Santa's really great, he does this every year and donates any money the nursery gives him to the Salvation Army. This year they talked us into getting into the picture - here's how we look today: \[caption id="attachment\_380" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="A Picture with Santa"\]![A Picture with Santa](images/DSC_0906-300x199.jpg "A Picture with Santa")\[/caption\]
