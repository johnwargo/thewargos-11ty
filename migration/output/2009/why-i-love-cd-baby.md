A long time ago, I spent a lot of time listening to Internet radio. There was some site I found (I can no longer remember its name) that had a great folk channel and I found a lot of great artists through it. One of them was a young lady by the name of [Michelle Lewis](http://www.michellelewismusic.com/) who has a new EP coming out soon if I remember correctly. Anyway, Michelle and many other artists sell their CD's through a company called CD Baby - it's an independent CD distributor that has a lot of great artists on board.

Yesterday I purchased a new CD from [Kendall Payne](http://www.kendallpayne.com/), another artist I love to listen to, from CD Baby. Check out this email I got from them notifying me that they'd shipped the CD:

> Your CD has been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow. A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure it was in the best possible condition before mailing. Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the crowd as he put your CD into the finest gold-lined box that money can buy. We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of Portland waved "Bon Voyage!" to your package, on its way to you, in our private CD Baby jet on this day, October 15, 2009. We hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby. In commemoration, we have placed your picture on our wall as "Customer of the Year." We're all exhausted but can't wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!

> Thank you, thank you, thank you! Sigh... We miss you already. We'll be right here at [http://cdbaby.com/](http://cdbaby.com/), patiently awaiting your return. -- CD Baby The little store with the best new independent music.

I love these guys, they seem to be having so much fun! If you get a chance, check out some of their artists.
