Just had a quick lunch at the BlackBerry Developer Conference. Its the first place ever that I've had commercially produced rice krispy treats that tasted home made. I had 4 of them, could have had more.

My publisher has been selling books all day and has sold at least 30 (out of the 75 he brought with him). Looks like its going to sell out before the book signing on thursday. I've been signing books as people buy them when I'm at the booth. Fun so far and looks like a success.

Here's a really blurry photo of the sign RIM created for the event.
