Well, I'm all alone this weekend and I'm (supposed to be) working on the book. I started chapter 14 Thursday night and my goal is to finish it today. I've decided that if I do this again, I'm going to put each chapter into its own folder - much easier when managing image files (screen shots).

Spent the morning getting caught up in my office. The bills are paid, deposits made and dry cleaning picked-up. No more delays!
