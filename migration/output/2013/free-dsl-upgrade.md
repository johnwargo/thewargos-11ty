I called my local phone and Internet provider (Windstream) today about upgrading my Internet bandwidth. They'd sent me a letter a while back about increased speeds in the neighborhood and I thought I'd see what it cost.

Well, surprise of surprises, it was free. I doubled my speed from 6 Mbs to 12 Mbs at no cost. How cool is that?
