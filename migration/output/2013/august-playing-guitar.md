August has been taking guitar lessons for a while. He really enjoys it and he's doing quite well (we think so, but his instructor says so as well). Anna had to go to the school yesterday for an event, so I had to take August there after his lesson. At the prescribed time, I headed over to the house and walked up to his room to see him playing with his instrutor. Here's the video.
