Last Friday I went to see an instrumental guitarist (Travis Larson Band) perform in concert. It was at a place called the Double Door Inn here in Charlotte and there were like 3 people there when we arrived before the show.  Because it was such a small audience, I got a chance to talk with Travis and he mentioned that he was doing a workshop at the local Guitar Center store near us on Wednesday night (last night).

August has been taking Guitar lessons and doing quite well with them, so I thought I'd take him to the performance. We went last night and watched the band do a small, private and awesome performance. I loved it, August loved it too (I think).

Anyway, they were raffling off some free microphone equipment and August won the grand prize. Here's a pic with August and Travis showing off his 'Major Award'  :-)
