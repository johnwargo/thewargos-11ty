Spent the weekend in the Ellicottville area snowmobiling with some friends. This picture was taken shortly before I headed to the airport to fly home. The friends I'm with are very close friends I've known for a very, very long time. Interestingly, I remembered later, I met the guy to my left twenty-six years ago today. Amazing.

We get together once or twice a year to do something interesting, hang out, drink, ride scary motor vehicles at a high (and dangerous) rate of speed, drink some more, shoot things and swap stories (and abuse) for hours on end. It is a wonderful thing.
