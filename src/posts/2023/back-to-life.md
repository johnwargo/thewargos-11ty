I brought the site back to life yesterday. I  stopped posting here back in 2017 because our  twins were in middle school and we were very worried about posting too much on the Internet; I switched primarily to Facebook posts from there. The twins are in college now and leading their own lives, so I felt it was time to come back in here and pick up writing again.

I had shoulder surgery three weeks ago, so I'm writing one-handed for three weeks more. Once Ii'm two-handed again, I'm going to fill in some blanks on the site like update you on the finished master bath remodel, our trip to Europe for the FIFA Women's World Cup tournament and more. 

Stay tuned!
