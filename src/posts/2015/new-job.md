I'm getting really excited about my new job. SAP eliminated my job on March 15 and gave me some time to find a new one. That time expired on April 15th, but fortunately I had options lined up. I had essentially three offers and accepted one of them (the one I was most interested in) yesterday.

I start my new job on May 4th; I will tell you all about it once I do.
