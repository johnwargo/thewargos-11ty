We figured out recently that it's been many, many years since Anna and I have taken a vacation together. Recently, my brother in law invited us to join them at their lake house to help celebrate his wife (Anna's sister's)…, um, ah, 30th birthday. I immediately jumped on the chance to have a getaway and Anna quickly approved.

Earlier this year, I was in Akron and, as per tradition, I made arrangements to have dinner with Abby. I love our little get togethers and it allows me to keep up with what she's doing. We had a nice, long chat over diner and again outside before heading to our cars, and before Abby left, she said "You know, if you and Anna ever want to get away for a while, I'd be happy to stay with the kids for you. It would give me a chance to get to know them better." Holy Crikey, you've got to be kidding me – Absolutely, you're on!

Anyway, with Abby lined up to watch the kids, we quickly purchased airfare for us (and for Abby) and started making plans.

Since this whole thing was a surprise for my sister in law's birthday, we couldn't let her know we were coming. The most challenging aspect of that is that I'm a shameless poster to Facebook (usually, not always), so when I'm out and about, I regularly check in so my friends know what I've been doing. One source of regular frustration is that she can't tell her sisters anything about what we're doing since they've already heard about it (from me) on Facebook. So, for this adventure, I wasn't able to publish ANYTHING about what was going on for fear that it would ruin the surprise.

On our vacation we did some amazing things, which I'll be writing about here, and it was killing me to not be able to tell anyone about it. Now that the trip is over, I'm going to be updating this blog with the details of this trip so my Aunt Jane and others that read this blog can learn about our trip.

My goal is going to be to post here an entry for each day of our trip. I'll try to do one a day, so they're all bunched up, but we'll see what happens.
