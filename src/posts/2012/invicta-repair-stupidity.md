Many years ago, I purchased a rugged watch from Ashford.com. I’d never heard of the manufacturer before, but it seemed like a sturdy watch and I liked the thick, rubber watchband. The only drawback I found was that it was a self-winding watch and it would simply run out of juice when I didn’t attention to it.

After many years, the watch band broke. It was a thick band and I had limited optimism that the local watch repair place at the mall would have a band that fit the watch. Therefore, it sat in a drawer for a very long time before I started looking on Invicta’s web site for repair options.  Turns out it’s $30 for the replacement watch band plus $24 simply to ship the watch back to me. Ugh. $50 simply to replace a rubber watch band?

Well, I waited a few months and finally sucked it up and sent the watch off for repair. Apparently Invicta watches are hot stuff, since the web site indicated that the watch I purchased for about $80 was actually worth about $300. They inspected the watch, let me know what the total cost was (I already knew) then took my credit card information and sent it off to be repaired.

That was almost 4 months ago.

The fine print I missed was that it takes 3 months to replace the watch band on an Invicta watch. Yep, three months. How ridiculous is that?

I paid for the repair and expected to receive some sort of email notification that they’d started the repair or actually completed it. I waited, and waited, and waited and learned nothing.  Next I started looking around on their web site – using the order information they gave me, I could NOT access any information about my watch’s repair. I finally called them to find out what was going on with my watch.

Turns out they send the watch OVERSEAS for repair. That’s why it takes three months apparently. Unfortunately for me, they did nothing with my watch for about 30 days THEN sent it overseas for repairs. How absolutely ridiculous that a company in the US will send a watch overseas to replace a watch band (at a ridiculous charge of $30) when I’m certain an American would do it for $5 (or possibly even less).

This is an example of a company simply thinking too much of itself and knowing they can gouge their customers. I know for certain that I won’t buy another Invicta watch.
