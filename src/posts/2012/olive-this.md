I’ve been writing a bit about some friends of ours who have opened a specialty olive oil and vinegar store in South Charlotte called Olive This!. Simply two housewives with an idea and a well-known distributor with a quality product. When I heard about what they were doing, I knew they’d need a web presence and immediately offered to help. I would have done it for free, but instead they plied me with cookies, brownies and other food items for my help.

I set them up with a hosting account (at [Fatcow](http://www.fatcow.com/join/index.bml?AffID=607551 "FatCow") of course) and a quick installation of WordPress. I guided them through the process of setting up their site’s structure and a little about the site’s look (I am NOT a designer). We got it pretty far before one of the partner’s husband (who is very talented) jumped in and started creating graphics for the site and tweaking the site’s content and look. It turned out beautifully and just went live this week at [www.olivethis.com](www.olivethis.com "Olive This!").  They even created [a Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Olive-This/348742675204684 "Olive This! Facebook Page") for the business.

Here's a snapshot of their web site, it looks really great:

Once they opened, some of their initial customers were involved with different publications in the area, so they’re already getting some great publicity. The first was an article in the local community paper about [new stores in the area](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/08/01/3407032/new-stores-opening-all-over-the.html "New Stores Opening in the Area") but I imagine more will come soon.

If you get a chance, swing by their store Olive This! – it’s located near Trader Joe’s at 6414 Rea Road, Charlotte, NC 28277. Their hours are Sunday from 12 PM to 5 PM & Monday through Saturday from 10 AM to 6 PM. You can reach them by phone at 704.544.8099.
