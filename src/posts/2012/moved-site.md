[![](images/site_moved-300x234.png "site_moved")](http://www.thewargos.com/2012/11/moved-site/site_moved/)

For years now I've had a web site located at [www.thewargos.com](http://www.thewargos.com "www.thewargos.com") plus this blog sitting underneath it ([www.thewargos.com/blog2](http://www.thewargos.com/blog2 "www.thewargos.com/blog2")). It simply didn't make sense to have both - especially since I'd not updated the web site in years. So, this week I essentially deleted the web site and moved this blog into its place. I'm sure there will be some problems, so over the next few days I'll do what I can to work out the kinks.

I have some content to copy over from the original site, so that will hopefully come over soon.

Also, for any of you who had bookmarked www.thewargos.com/blog2 or blog.thewargos.com, I'm going to create a warning page that displays then redirects you to this site. Be sure to update your bookmarks to simply use the www.thewargos.com web site going forward.

One problem that exists, and existed before I moved the site, is that my twitter feed is no longer coming into this site. I had it configured so my personal tweets ([@jwargo23](https://twitter.com/jwargo23 "https://twitter.com/jwargo23")) appeared as a summary post every day. I need to figure out how to fix that.
