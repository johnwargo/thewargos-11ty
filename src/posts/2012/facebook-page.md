![McNelly SoftWorks Logo](images/msw_logo_md.jpg)

I discovered yesterday that my little side business, McNelly SoftWorks, has a Facebook page. I didn't create a Facebook page for the business, but apparently it's had one for several years now. Here's a [link to the page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/McNelly-Softworks/162508630443365?ref=ts&fref=ts "Link to McNelly SoftWorks Facebook Page") - I'm going to make some nice graphics for the page just to experiment with it.

What's amazing is how many public listings there are for the company - all listing my old Akron address. Looks like hundreds of sites downloaded the Yellow Pages listings and made entries for my business (which isn't actually much of a business, simply a place for me to earn some extra cash). Do a quick Google Search for _McNelly SoftWorks_ and you'll see what I mean.

What started this search was me working on an updated web site for the business. I'd built the original site using NetObjects Fusion, a web site generator, and I've had a task on my to-do list for years now to convert it to a system like WordPress or Joomla. I've got some 'things' I want to do with the business, so I thought a more modern approach to the company's web site would be in order. I'm copying over the content and hope to have the new site up in a week or so. I've even asked a friend to do an overhaul of the logo and we'll see how that works out. Stay tuned.
