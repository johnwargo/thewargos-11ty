We're watching a neighbor's dog this week. We watch a bunch of different dogs, but it's the first time this particular dog has been with us. It's going to be interesting - it's a big dog and apparently it's allowed on furniture, sleeps in bed with its owners and steals food. That's going to be interesting since we don't let dogs on furniture, don't let dogs sleep in our room (because of my allergies) and our dogs don't (usually) take food that's not been given to them.

Hopefully at least this dog won't pee in the house (twice) like our last canine guest did.
