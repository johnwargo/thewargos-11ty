OK, so I got sick again- yuck. I was in Columbia, MD and tried to come home Thursday when I got really sick, but my boss (rightfully so) suggested I see how I felt Friday. Well, I felt HORRIBLE Friday and made beeline for home. It was a mess, I was sick all the way home but was able to get on the earliest flight home. Rushed to the house, climbed into bed and spent most of the next 18 hours there.  It was the worst I'd felt in years. I went to see my Doctor and turns out I had a 99.6 temperature.

Abby came to visit this weekend. She's 15.5 and has her temporary license. Wow, she's driving now, amazing. I made a point of letting her drive my car and Anna's, she did really well.

We went to see the new Disney movie, 'Up' I think it's called. Good, but once again, Disney made an adult movie for kids. Very good, but VERY ADULT and VERY SAD. August and Elizabeth really didn't understand much of what was going on. Too bad for Disney/Pixar - they should get back to making movies for kids.

We had a house showing today, so Anna and I took the kids and dogs out to Sand Run Park for a long hike through the hills. Everyone loved it. We went out for ice cream afterwards and of course the kids loved that.

Need to wrap up the book. I thought I had about 3 weeks of work to finish the last chapters, but the major reviewer delivered their comments this morning and it's a mess. They're trying to completely rewrite the book. It's going to take me 10 hours or more just to dig through all of their comments (more than 100 in some chapters) and use the good stuff and ignore the rest. Problem is I have 4 more to give them this week and 9 more chapters to wrap up and get into the editing/review process.  I have about 4 and a half chapters to finish and get into the process. I'm not going to make my deadline, but I won't miss it by much. I do need to get this book done, I miss my family and I know they miss me.
