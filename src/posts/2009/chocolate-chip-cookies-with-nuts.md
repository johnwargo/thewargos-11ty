Panera (or at least the one I ate at recently) is no longer selling Chocolate Chip Cookies with Nuts. They've been selling them for years and are my favorite one and they just stopped selling them. The still sell the regular ones (without nuts) but not the ones I want. When I asked, someone there said it was because of safety reasons.  

I don't know about you, but I was never hurt by a Chocolate Chip cookie with nuts. Not even the slightest bit. I know it's probably because of nut allergies, but this is ridiculous. Did I mention that they'd been selling them for years? How did they all of a sudden become unsafe? People that have nut allergies shouldn't but them - see how simple that it? Anyone who has nut allergies will immediately see that Panera sells many items with nuts in them and will have to expect that there's risk.  

I imagine that after looking around for about 30 seconds that they'll just go somewhere else to eat. Everyone is so PC and worried about safety, and it's killing the enjoyment of life for us normal people.
