Well, after working a full day, I promised the kids a bike ride tonight. It was a beautiful day and I thought it would be fun to get out. I'd planned on having pizza for dinner, but as I started to plan the bike ride, I decided I'd try letting them ride to someplace for dinner. We decided on Panera, about a mile away, and off we went. The kids did awesome!Â  We had a nice long ride and a ton of fun.

I let them sleep in the pull out bed again tonight, lets see how long Elizabeth makes it before I haull her ass upstairs to sleep in her own bed. Hopefully she knows I mean business.
