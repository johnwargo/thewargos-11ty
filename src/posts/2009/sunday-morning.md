Well, It's a cold, dark Sunday morning.

August got sick Friday after leaving a Fancy Nancy Birthday party. Anna stayed up all night with him as he got sick over and over and over again. Slow, lazy day yesterday within almost everyone on the couch watching TV.

I have some work to do before I exit my current job, so I worked on that late into the night on Friday and part of Saturday. Today I need to give this work a thorough read and get it off for review so I can finish it up before my termination date (Friday).

I've got a few options lined up for a job - hoping to get one or more job offers next week. I need to make a decision by Friday since I'm unemployed after that. The good news is that I like each of the options I have before me - so it will good to have to make a decision (assuming I am able to get more than one offer).
