We had an amazing day yesterday. We had breakfast and I had to scurry to accommodate a late scheduled showing of the house. Turns out they though the back yard was too small.  Oh well. 

After they left, we went on a bike ride then came home and had lunch. After lunch we decided to head out to Hinkley to climb on some cliffs. The kids were AMAZING climbing around. We spend more than an hour climbing around and doing some pretty scary stuff. I sent Anna photos of them and she got really nervous. Everyone had a great time and nobody got hurt. We're going back there next weekend with Anna.

After the ledges (Whipps Ledges) we headed over to a lake nearby. There were hundreds of people out and a whole bunch of dogs. The kids took off their shoes and waded in and played with the dogs.  Elizabeth and August even got to touch a snake that was slithering through the lake. We vowed to take the dogs back some day (more on that later).

At the end of the day, everyone had a great time and the kids were great listeners. They slept like babies!
