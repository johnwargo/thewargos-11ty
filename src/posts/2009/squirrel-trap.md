August found a bunch of acorns recently and this weekend he and Elizabeth decided to try to actually catch a squirrel using them. They laid out a path of acorns leading to a box and planned on jumping out to drop the box on any squirrel that ventured out to eat the acorns.

I showed him to tie a string to the end of a stick and pull the stick out to trap the squirrel in the box. He loved it. He immediately setup three traps and sat there patiently, hiding, waiting for a squirrel to come eat the acorns. I didn't have the heart to tell him he probably wouldn't catch one.
