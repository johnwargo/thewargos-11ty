A long time ago I registered jwargo.com because I thought I'd do a personal blog there. My original thoughts were to try to use some free Domino-based blog software that was available but I never got around to it. Now with my ISP (Fatcow - [www.fatcow.com](http://www.fatcow.com)) offering so much free software I thought I would try making this work. When you get a chance, check out [www.jwargo.com](http://www.jwargo.com).
