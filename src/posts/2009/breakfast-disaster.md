Anna's back is still out although we did get to the Doctor yesterday and have a plan for her recovery. I went to the gym this morning early and when I got home I smelled something burning outside when I came home. As I went inside, the burning smell got stronger. When I arrived in the kitchen, the twins were sitting at the table eating breakfast and Anna was laying down. Turns out the kids got up early and went downstairs to fix breakfast. Elizabeth put a slice of cinnimon chip bread into a plastic bowl and put it in the microwave. Unfortunately, the kids didn't know how to use the microwave and the bowl they selected was not microwave safe. Needless to say, the kids now know they're not allowed to use the microwave and we're short one bowl.
