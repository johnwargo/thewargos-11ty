No, not THAT chapter 11, chapter 11 of my book.

I submitted the remaining chapters for review and got an email from one of the reviewers indicating that she had some problems with the chapter and wanted to talk about it. We chatted for a while and I agreed with her. I'd written about what I knew about BlackBerry Java Development, but I didn't present the information in as structured of a way as was needed for the book. I asked her to write-up her concerns and I'd rewrite the chapter with her comments in mind. Well, she gave me an outline to use to structure the content and it was spot on. I've studied her outline, adjusted it a little bit and now I'm using it as a guide for the rewrite. Ultimately this will make it a better book, but I'm truly not excited to be back in writing mode again.

The entire first half of the book has been through the edit and review process, so it should be up on Safari Books Online in a couple of weeks. Now all I need to do is finish 11 (and any corresponding changes that happen in the appendix) and get the content off for review.

It looks like I will actually be done with the book on schedule and, because I wrapped up the review into the editing process, I may actually see the book released early. I've been getting a lot of attention this week on the Internet. Berryreview.com wrote about the book and many of the other blogs picked it up. There were even some translations into Spanish that popped up a day later. I'll try to post all of the links to <a href="http://www.bbdevfundamentals.com" target="\_blank">www.bbdevfundamentals.com</a> when I get a chance.
