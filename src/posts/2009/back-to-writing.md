OK, I finally finished getting through the final reviewer's comments. It was arduous - in one chapter, there were more comments than could fit on the page. As much as I hated putting aside the writing to spend an entire week processing a reviewer's comments, their comments in general were helpful for the book. In many cases, they were looking too much at the book from their perspective (how they'd write it) but in others the comments were spot on and helped some of the rough spots in the book.

I really wish I had time to go back and do a complete edit/rewrite on the chapters, but I'm so far behind on writing that I'm not sure how much more 'reading' I'm going to be able to do.

My good friend David Via wrote an amazing forward for the book - Anna got all misty when she read it. It's nice to have good friends to support you!
