I'm playing around with WordPress - I added some plug-ins (like a social networking plug-in that allows you to post something you find interesting to your Facebook or other social networking profile)) and changed the template.

Right now I'm working on giving you a way to subscribe to the blog so you will be emailed whenever I add something new to the blog. I think I have it setup correctly. You will have to Register with the site to be able to manage your profile. Look for the Register link in the 'Meta' Category on the right side of the page.
