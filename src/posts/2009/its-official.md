The publisher has decided on a title for the book!  The book is going to be called BlackBerry Development Fundamentals (the working title was Fundamentals of BlackBerry Development, so this is close to what I was thinking would be a good title).  The book should be up on amazon.com soon, look for the book by title or use the ISBN's for the book: ISBN-10: 0321647424 or ISBN-13: 9780321647429.

I have 5 chapters in the editing process and hope to have the 6th in at the end of the weekend.  I'm halfway through writing chapter 10, so I'm more than halfway done (10.5/16). I'm having fun, but I'll be happy when I can stop working into the we hours of the night.
