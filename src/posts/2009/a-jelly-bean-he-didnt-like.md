Who'd a thunk it?  August and Elizabeth got some jelly beans somewhere yesterday and we let them eat them after lunch today. August got a white one that he really didn't like. He was c0ol about it, but had to quickly get it out of his mouth as quickly as possible.  He then grabbed a napkin and started wiping his mouth out (the inside) trying to get all of the taste out.  He even got a glass of water and rinsed his mouth out.  Amazing, who would have thought he would hate a piece of candy so much.

I wonder if he ever got the taste out...
