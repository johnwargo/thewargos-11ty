I just don’t know what’s going on with Dell. I love their computers – every computer I’ve ever bought was a Dell and anyone who asks me what to get is told to buy a Dell.

I am trying to upgrade the memory on Anna’s laptop. I’m going to upgrade it to Windows 7 and I also have to take it with me to a conference and I want it to be faster. Last weekend I logged into Dell’s web site, looked up her configuration and purchased what I thought was the correct memory upgrade. As soon as I completed the order, I started poking around and found more detail about here configuration. It turns out that I need to upgrade her machine by replacing the memory rather than augmenting it (my bad for not looking) so I immediately purchased a second memory module (the exact same as the first one).  Shipping was free and I was going to pay tax either way, so it was no big deal to duplicate the order (or so I thought).

Well I received two order acknowledgements; they sent two payments through PayPal but only shipped one order. As I checked over and over again for shipping status for the second order I finally called Dell because the second order was not showing shipped – it didn’t even show any products on it! Crikey!!

I get Customer Care on the phone and they can’t find any reference to the second order. Crap. They transfer me to Sales (explaining that they will be able to find the order) and Sales can’t find it. They helpfully offer to transfer me to Customer Care but I refused (I’d already been there). I finally had to reorder the second memory module and I’m really upset at all of the wasted time. They’re denying it, but what I think happened was that as soon as they saw the second order, so close to the first one, they believed it was a duplicate and DELETED IT! What a bunch of idiots. I wouldn’t have minded if they contacted me and asked me about it, but they didn’t and now I’m not going to be able to have the machine upgraded in time to go to the conference.

Dell makes great computers at a great price but I’m serious when I say they they have completely let customer service go by the wayside.
