Well, I did it. I'm halfway through the book. I finished chapter 8 last night and I'm pretty excited. I'm at about 200 pages right now and per my publishing contract I'm supposed to deliver a book of approximately 400 pages. I also have 17 chapters planned for the book and the last couple of them are pretty short, so at 8 chapters, I'm at about half.

I guess in my mind I really didn't think this thing was real until I'd gotten half of the book behind me. I'm enjoying working with the editor, I'm getting the help from RIM that I need and I should be able to get the first few chapters over for editing by next weekend. I've got a bunch of people reviewing the chapters and I am waiting for the last reviews before I send them over. Once the editing is done, the book will go up online at [Safari Books Online](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/) and people can start reading it and pre-order copies.

I'm speaking at a Domino Developer and Administrator conference in Boston in April and the sponsors of that event want to promote my book on the [Lotus User Group](http://lotususergroup.org/glug.nsf/MainForm) web site. So that's cool.

One of my best friends is an executive at IBM and he's asked for permission to write the forward for the book, that's exciting too
