We had an issue a while back where the kids gave a sitter a horrible time going to bed. One of the things that happened was that they pulled one of the curtains off the wall in their room. It took me a while to rebuild the rod holder so it could go back up.  On Wednesday afternoon I finally got it back up and it seemed sturdier than before.

Well, last night the kids went down well (I thought) but ended up not being able to sleep. August was looking out the window and somehow pulled the curtain rod down **again!**  Needless to say, we're pretty upset and I really don't know how I'm going to get it back up there in a way that will stay.
