I went to the gym this morning and at my desk at about 7 getting caught up on email (and doing a little with the book). I took a shower and was back at my desk to start work on my real job. Â I heard some noise upstairs and thought Anna was up but it turned out to be Elizabeth. She'd gotten a chair and climbed up and got her cereal (multi-grain Cheerios) and had her bowl full and had gotten a spoon. I helped her with the milk although if I had not come up, she definitely would have been able to get it herself.

My babies are growing up.
