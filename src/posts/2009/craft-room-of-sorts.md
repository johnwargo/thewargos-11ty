Last weekend when Anna and I finished a lot of the cleanup of the laundry room (basically consolidating photos into a smaller number of boxes) we threw away a storage cabinet I used to use for all of my soccer stuff. During the kitchen remodel, we used it to store all of our foodstuff and I made two small, stacking tables to fit inside one part of it so we could have more shelves. Well, with the little tables sitting on the floor the kids of course wanted them. I told them they could have them and they immediately stacked them against the wall then went upstairs and grabbed paper, pens, and other implements and created a little craft area right there against the wall in the laudry room.

It's right next to some food storage we keep in the basement, so they're constantly pulling stuff off the shelf and tracing it on some picture they're creating. It's very fun to watch - they spend hours down there creating things while Anna and I go through stuff in the basement.
