Anna and I just played a game of Trouble with the twins. It was a lot of fun and interesting as the tables turned on each of us as we played. For a while, August was the clear leader but in a few quick rolls, he was effectively out of the game. Anna's relentless when it comes to sending people back home and Elizabeth amazed me with her calm demeanor as she got stuck home with all of her pieces for most of the game - she never gave up and didn't get frustrated at all.  August finally got tired and started acting ugly and what was a fun evening ended up being kinda a pain.  Oh well, they're 6.
