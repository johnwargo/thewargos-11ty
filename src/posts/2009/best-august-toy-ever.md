We head up to Chicago at least once a year to spend some time with Anna's friends. We usually end up spending a lot of time with one of her friends who lives on a circle at the end of the road. They have three girls, a lot of toys and a lot of room to play in the street. They had this little pedal car and August fell in love with it. After the second year of visiting and August spending all of his time in the car, we finally got him one. It's called a Kettcar and it's made by a company called Kettler. He LOVES it - spends a whole bunch of time just sitting in it or pedaling around the driveway.

He's too big for it, but has the seat pushed back as far as it can go. We'll replace it when we get to our new house (haven't sold the old one yet). It's really an awesome toy.
