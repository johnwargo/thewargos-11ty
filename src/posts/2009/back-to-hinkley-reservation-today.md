After breakfast this morning we tossed our suits on, threw the dogs in the back of the van and headed back to Hinkley Reservation. The dogs had a blast and the kids played in the sand.  After that it was home for lunch then off to the airport to pick Anna up.  We were waiting for her with a can of Krazy String.  It was pink and she got covered.
