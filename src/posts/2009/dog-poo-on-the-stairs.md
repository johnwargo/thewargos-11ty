So I got up early this morning (like at 3:23 AM) and went off to the gym (at about 6). When I came home, nobody else was up (although someone should have been) so the dogs were there to greet me. I took them downstairs to feed them and when I came back upstairs I noticed that I had dog poo on my shoe and there was some on each of three alternating steps into the basement. I guess what happened was that one of the dogs (I didn't recognize the poo) had to go and let one piece sneak out on the way down to eat (eating been considered much more important than 'doing their business') and I inadvertently stepped in it.

Anyway, I stripped off my shoes and went about my morning - eventually cleaning up the poo when I made it back downstairs to get to work finding a new job. When I came back upstairs, Anna said 'you cleaned it up huh?'  Talk about hurting my feelings - she actually thought I'd leave it for her?  As much fun as that would have been - I knew there was no way I'd get away with that. She did though really hurt my feelings - apparently she actually thought there was a possibility I'd leave it for her to clean it up.  Never once did I pass on a dirty diaper - why would she think all of a sudden I'd be lazy?
