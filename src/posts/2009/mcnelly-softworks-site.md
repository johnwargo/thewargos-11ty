I decided to start doing some things with the [McNelly SoftWorks](http://www.mcnellysoftworks.com) web site. Â I'm going to rework the whole site using Joombra, an open source content management system. I think I'm even going to kill FormBlaster as a product. I never sold many licenses and it' silly to keep it up there.

I'm then going to rebuild the [newsoccerref.com](http://www.newsoccerrefs.com) web site for my first book. I'm also going to start work on [BlackBerry Development Fundamentals](http://www.bbdevfundamentals.com) web site using the same tools. I'll let you know when it's all ready.
