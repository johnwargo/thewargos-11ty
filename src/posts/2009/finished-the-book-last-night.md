Yep, it's finished! Wow, a whole bunch of work that was. Now all I have to do is finish the review/edit phase and (woohoo!) it's ready to publish.

So, here's where it stands:

- Chapters 1 through 9 have been through the edit and review process
- Chapters 10 and 11 are in the review process
- I still need to give 12 through 18 a read and submit them to the reviewers and editors

Making progress!
