More expected today. Flooding everywhere. It's amazing to see how much dirt is getting washed away everywhere. Woke up the other morning to find several incnes of mud in my dryer. The window well fills up and it flows down the vent into my dryer. Repair man comes this morning, we'll see if the dryer is toast (I'm sure it is, Anna's not convinced).
