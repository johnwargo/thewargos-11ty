It had been a while since I spoke with my friend Laura. I'd had the kids and got pretty busy and we never seemed to have time to catch up. A few weeks ago I emailed her and said hello, she replied with a very nice, long message documenting everything that was going on with her.Â  Turns out that she's opening a restaurant (actually, it opened yesterday). For dinner last night, we all climbed into the van and headed over to her place.

It's a chain, pizza and ribs restaurant. We knew the kids would eat pizza so we thought it would be fun. When we arrived (it's about 15 miles away) we found that it was not a sit down restaurant, but takeout only. We weren't that excited about taking pizza home with us, but decided to go in anyway. Turns out that they had a couple of tables, so we caught up with Laura and Joe and ordered some food. We hung out in the restaurant waiting for the food to be ready and chatted with everyone there. It was a pretty crazy place being the first day, but the food was excellent and Laura looked great. It was so much fun to see her after all of these years.
