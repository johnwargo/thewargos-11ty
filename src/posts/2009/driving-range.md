August wanted to go to the driving range tonight, so after I finished work today, August and I grabbed some clubs and headed out. I purchased him a large bucket of balls and he hit all of them. It's hard to keep him from spinning around with every shot, but when he stood straight and didn't spin, he hit the ball 20 yards. Very nice.

I'll take Elizabeth to the range next weekend.
