I was flying out of CLE this morning and was struck by the size of this jewelry store right inside the C concourse. There can't possibly be enough sales to support this HUGE store. I expect it exists because of guilt purchases (away from home too much or just wrapped up a tryst with your mistress) but this is ridiculous.
