Anna had a death in the family Thursday, so she's out of town for the funeral and I'm home with the kids. She left this morning and we've been playing. Did you know we have a mountain in the house? Â Yep, we've been exploring it for the last hour - way cool. There's a castle upstairs and a craft room too (with a craft table with August's name on it already).
