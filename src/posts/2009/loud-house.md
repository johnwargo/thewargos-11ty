I forgot to mention that with the incredibly low temperatures, the house is making a whole bunch of really loud sounds. Anna and I were woken up last night with bumps and snaps we'd never heard before.

This morning on the way to the gym, the car's temperature showed it was 25 degrees (probably the temp the last time I drove it) - it was 7 by the time I made it three blocks then zero by the time I hit the traffic light (about six blocks) then -6 by the time I made it to the gym. That's the fastest I've ever seen the car thermometer drop; I guess Newton's Law of Cooling applies in the extreme when it's like this.
