No, not because I don't have to work for a little while - because of this...

I came in from mowing the lawn and was washing my hands for dinner when 'In the End' by Rush came on the radio. I immediately CRANKED it and sand the song for the kids. When the LOUD part came on, the kids got off their chairs and we all held hands and danced. It was so cool - dancing with my kids listening to Rush. Any Rush fan's dream time with their children ;-)
