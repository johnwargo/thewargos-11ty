We were playing Saturday night in the back yard and the kids were wetting me down with the hose. I snuck out the backyard and into the garage to grab a spray bottle to get them back. Anna gave me away and as I closed the garage door to buy some time, Elizabeth grabbed the door as it closed and forced it open.

Unfortunately, she bent the door and popped out one of the panels in doing that. Rats. I was upset, but not much. I was rather impressed with her ingenuity and strength. She put herself in timeout. Too funny.

Everything is fine, I pounded out the door.
