Well, the last thing I had to do (writing-wise) on the book was finish chapter 10. The chapter is about some beta tools, so RIM was nice enough to give me the screen captures I needed for the book. I got them all in and need a few more - I should be able to FINISH the book tomorrow night. All I can say is...Wow!
