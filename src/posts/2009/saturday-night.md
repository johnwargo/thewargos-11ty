Well, didn't get as far as I wanted on chapter 14, but still got a tremendous amount done. I'm going to have to finish this one up tomorrow morning, hopefully won't take me past noon. Turns out the chapter is pretty nice. Learned a lot about a tool I hadn't used much. I've got to finish this chapter tomorrow and make real headway on 15. Running...out...of...time!
