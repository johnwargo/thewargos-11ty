Anna threw out her back in the morning but we stillÂ spent all day yesterday going through our filing cabinet tossing everything we just don't need anymore. We got everything down from two drawers (lateral file drawer) down to one. I loaded up Anna's car with 10 bags of paper to take to the recycling center.
