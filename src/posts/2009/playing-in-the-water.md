Whenever I'm home alone with the kids on a Saturday (Anna's out of town this weekend) I always make sure I get caught up on the laundry. As soon as the kids see the water in the tub, they start their regular water play. First they dig out this 'thing' we have that's supposed to get cobwebs out of stuff - the poke around the ceiling and get it all cleaned up. Once that's done, they get mops, squeegees and other implements of cleaning and start dumping water from the tub and cleaning the laundry room floor. It's so funny to watch and they love doing it - just mopping the floor like they have no cares.

Pretty soon the clothes start to come off (theirs, not mine) and they start slipping and sliding across the wet, concrete floor. Today, they got buckets of water out and dumped copious quantities on the floor then took running starts and slid all the way across the floor on their bellies (half naked of course). They'll do that for hours if I let them, it's way too funny - I'll try to film it next time they do it.
