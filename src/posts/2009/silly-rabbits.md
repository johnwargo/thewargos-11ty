A few years ago we had these silly rabbits that built a nest and had babies in the flower bed right outside our back porch door. It didn't take long for the dogs to find them and kill a few bunnies. How stupid - the dogs are outside chasing rabbits every day, you'd think they'd know.

Well, I went outside the other day and there appears to be a new nest -even closer to the door and more easily visible.
