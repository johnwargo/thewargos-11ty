A few weeks ago I was playing with the kids in the den and decided they would think it was cool to learn that the sofa was actually a pull-out bed. August immediately asked if they could sleep on it and I readily agreed. Well, Anna is out of town this weekend (looking for houses in Charlotte) and as soon as we started home from the airport the kids started asking if they could sleep in the pull-out bed tonight. I agreed as long as the entire house was picked up by the time they were supposed to go to bed.

All went well for a while, but Elizabeth and August just couldn't go to sleep. I warned them several times, but eventually I had to drag Elizabeth upstairs to sleep in her regular bed. She kept coming out of the room and it was getting later and later. She eventually went to sleep at about 10, way too late for a little girl like her.

We'll see what happens tonight, I'm going to give her one more chance to stay in bed.
