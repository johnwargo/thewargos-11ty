Had a couple of showings last week and one yesterday.

It's interesting to watch this whole thing play out. We dropped the initial price of the house based upon the listing price of a larger (but not as nice) house on the street behind us. As soon as we did that, they dropped their price by $30k only three weeks after listing it.

The first people to look at our house were the realtors selling the larger (and much more expensive but not as nice) house on our same street. They immediatly dropped the price of their house by $30k.

It's crazy. Houses aren't being priced based upon their worth, everyone is letting everyone around them drive their house prices down. It's definately a buyers market and it's going to be interesting to see how this goes for us. We're pretty happy with our listing price, but we expect that if we get an offer it's going to be crazy low - just because of how the market is acting right now.

Crazy, I'll say it again, crazy!
