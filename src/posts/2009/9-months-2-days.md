That's how long it takes to 'write' a 500 page computer book. I started the process on December 1st, 2008 and it's pretty much consumed my after-hours life since then. I have:

- Written 17 chapters and 3 appendices
- Captured screen shots or drawn figures for about 200 images for the book
- Been through the editing process with the 'Development Editor'
- Been through the review process with about 6 reviewers plus a review committee for a major player who shall remain nameless
- Sliced, diced and crammed as much information as I can in the book.

It turns out that it's probably going to be too long. My publishing contract says 400 pages, I think I wrote about 600 pages and the editor has whacked it down to what I hope is about 500 pages (big, but not too big).

Now all I have to do is relax for a while. I'm still waiting for a couple of small reviews then the publisher will release the book to the production department and I get to start the spelling, grammar and punctuation portion of this process. I'm on schedule, so none of this should delay the book's publish date (which is October 16th if you care).

Now I can go back to being a normal human for a few weeks as the production process starts. I wonder if my wife and kids remember me...
