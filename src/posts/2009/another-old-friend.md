An old friend of mine looked me up the other day. It was awesome to hear from him. We hadn't talked in more than 10 years and it was great to catch up. He just called and we spent some time chatting while the kids mopped the laundry room. It gave a chance to talk, but the basement is now full of water and the kids are soaked.
