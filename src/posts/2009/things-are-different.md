Things sure are different here now that the kids are in school. Let's go through some of the changes:

- The kids are going to bed at about the same time they went to bed a year ago - any creeping of bed time was erased when we realized they had to be at school by 8:15 AM.
- The house is empty the majority of the day - really weird.
- Anna's actually able to get things done around the house and quite a few responsibilities have been removed from my shoulders

Now that Anna has some free time

- I no longer have primary responsibility for doing the laundry.
- I no longer have to take my clothes to the dry cleaner's - she has agreed to take care of that again.
- She's even doing the ironing - something neither of us have had the time to do since the twins were born.

It's really so cool - the kids all of a sudden seem...older. I dropped them off at school this morning and it was so weird to pull up, open the door and say 'see ya later' without any worry. I really like this.
