Well, Stucco is on the walls and we're very slowly making progress.Â  The painters are supposed to be here today painting the trim, but of course they're nowhere to be found. Anna's over there doing some more priming; we're supposed to paint the downstairs this weekend and she'll do the upstairs next week while the kids are in school. For some bizarre reason I'm having a really hard time getting her to actually buy paint. I don't understand it, but it is what it is. Theoretically the hardwood will be delivered next week and the floors will go in soon after.

Here's pictures before and after stucco.
