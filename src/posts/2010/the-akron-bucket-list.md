OK, so I’ve lived in Akron my entire life. The house I live in today is the house my parents moved into when my mother was pregnant with me. I have long, strong ties to Akron – although not because it’s Akron. It’s just because that’s where I have lived all of my life and it’s just home. I’m fortunate that I’ve traveled all over the United States and parts of the world (China, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Mexico, Canada, France, Monte Carlo and Italy – I think that’s it). I’ve gotten to know all sorts of places, but Akron has just always been home.

When I married, my blushing bride began lobbying for a move to The South (notice the capitalization). Coming from the Deep South (notice the capitalization and note that it’s very different than The South), she missed the weather and the people. I owned a business in Akron, had a very well established Soccer Referee career and a father I needed to take care of.  I was able to say: “I can’t leave, I have all of these things here.” and earned some time to adjust to the idea of moving away from my 'home'. Over the years, one by one, those ‘things’ that kept me here went away and it was time to head south.

We started planning and arranged things so we could make the move south. We selected Charlotte, North Carolina because it was a growing, beautiful town, was an airline hub (important for my job) and we had friends there. We cleaned up our house, dumped a bunch of junk we didn’t need, fought a lot about the scrap wood, watched the housing market collapse then put my family home up for sale. After about 8 months on the market, we got our only two offers (including one that was just right) right before Christmas. Here it was, the house was sold and we had to hurry to get a new one.

Immediately after Christmas, we packed up the kids and the dogs and headed to my brother’s house. He and his wife were off for the week between Christmas and New Year’s day, so they offered to watch everyone while we went house hunting. On the first day in Charlotte, after about the third house, we found our dream (ish) home. It’s beautiful, we love it and I’ve posted photos to this site.

Here we go, it’s time to move and we’ve started packing. Everything’s gone great with our buyers, they’re approved, the house appraised well and we’re past the inspection. We’re ready to close. In Charlotte everything is all ready for us – as soon as we close Akron, we’re approved and ready to close in Charlotte. Lots of packing to do and I’ve learned that Anna and I pack using VERY different methodologies – interesting, but not stressful. When she gets into FCLM (Full Crazy Lady Mode) like she does when packing for a move or a trip, I just stay out of her way and get my stuff done the way I want to do it. It makes it easier and saves my marriage. Perhaps I’ll write more about this later.

Anyway, I’m leaving Akron and of course there are some things I need to do before I leave. I need to hit all of those Akron-esque things that I just won’t have in Charlotte. So, I’ve started building the list in my head and one by one getting to them. Here it is, the Akron Bucket List:

1. Skyway Drive-In – Got to have my double cheeseburger (plain of course), fries and California (M&B Grape Punch Concentrate and Ginger Ale – very nice!). Done!
2. Swenson’s Drive-In – Same as above but Tater Tots instead of Fries.
3. Lugi’s Pizza – An Akron staple since 1949. Small Sausage Pizza with extra Sausage plus one of those cheesy (very cheesy) salads). Done!
4. Dontino’s Restaurant – Home made Veal Parmesean and homemade pasta. Done!  Their Lasagna is home made as well, you should try it some time
5. Michael’s AM – local Breakfast-only restaurant. Country Fried Steak and Eggs!
6. Winking Lizard – local restaurant chain – specializes in homemade soups. This Thursday they’re making my favorite: Cheeseburger Soup. Meet me there at 1:00 on 01/28/10 to join me for lunch – Winking Lizard Tavern in Fairlawn, Ohio (Ghent Road and Market Street across from Summit Mall).

Interesting that it’s all food, eh?

We visited the cemetery last week and said goodbye to my relatives (left a Budweiser for Mom).

I can’t think of anything else I need to make sure I do here before I leave. What else am I missing? Help me finish out this list and get all of those ‘Akron’ things done before I leave!
