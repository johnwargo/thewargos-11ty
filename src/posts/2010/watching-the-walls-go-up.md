Well, after many (many, many) problems and delays, the walls are finally going up on my new garage/office/workshop.  Half of the wood was delivered yesterday and the framers started framing early this morning. Two walls are up and the back wall is being built in place.  They'll have the front wall installed before lunch and may even get started on the floor joist installation. They may even have the second floor framed today.

Here are some pictures.

All of us have been spending most of the morning sitting on the back porch watching the workers work away. It's mesmerizing - I had to pull myself away several times today to go back to work.

Of course Anna and I looked at the first floor and we're so scared about how tall this building is really going to be. There's no getting around it, but it's hard to look at this thing and not miss our view of the back yards.  I'll have a great view from my office, but the back deck looses so much of its charm.
