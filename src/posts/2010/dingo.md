A small crew was at the house today working on filling the foundation and roughing in the plumbing. I'd asked the guy moving the dirt around if August could get a ride some time and he kindly agreed. At the end of his day, he let both August and Elizabeth drive his Dingo - the machine you see in the following pictures. The kids had a blast, couldn't believe he was letting them drive by themselves.
