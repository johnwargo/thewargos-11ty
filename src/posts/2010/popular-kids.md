August has been bugging us for some time now to let him go over to a classmate’s house (let’s call her Suzie). He’s made us drive into her cul-de-sac to try to find her house and this weekend I promised we’d ride our bikes over there to see if we could see her outside. We headed over and found them – her and her sister (go ahead and crank on my grammar) rushed over to see the twins and Suzie gave August a huge hug. They rushed off to play while I met the father and later the mother. It’s so cool to see the kids make friends, but the huge hug he got was…interesting. I didn’t know 6 year olds hugged that much, but a lot of girls hug August.

As I talked to the parents, it turns out that they used to live in Akron – even worked for the Beacon Journal (the local newspaper). We stood in the yard and talked about neighborhoods,  Luigis,  Szalay’s corn and more. It was fun.  I promised to bring them some Szalay’s corn if I can on my next trip home. We even talked about having some shipped – I offered to get some myself to help reduce their shipping cost. Apparently you can’t get corn like that here. Rats.

After we left Suzie’s house, we headed over to the house of that boy who called Elizabeth the other day. He’s apparently a first grader, smitten with Elizabeth and lives just about 2 blocks down the road from our house. Same thing with her – when the boy came home (I was talking with a neighbor when they came home) Elizabeth got a huge hug from this boy.  We have a play date scheduled with him on Tuesday and even August’s invited (which is good).

It’s so nice to see the kids make friends and get such warm welcomes from their classmates. The mother of August’s friend said several times how nice and social August was. Good to hear – now if I can only get Elizabeth to pay attention to one thing for more than a minute we may be in good shape.
