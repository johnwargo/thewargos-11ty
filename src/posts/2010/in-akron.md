I had lunch at Sky-Way drive-in in Akron today. Haven't done that since we left town six months and a day ago. It was nice to sit there and feel back home again. Afterwards I headed off to the West Side Bakery to pick up some cookies before heading off to visit with an old neighbor. The old house looks great and the neighborhood looks great as well. Nice to be home again.
