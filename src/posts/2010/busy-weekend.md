Well, we just finished a very busy weekend. My sister and her family came in to town and we had a lot of fun hanging out. The twins loved playing with their cousins and it got pretty crazy here while they were in town. I cooked the traditional big turkey dinner on Thursday and Anna says it was the best ever.

On Friday we avoided Black Friday and got some things done around the house. Ed and I installed timer switches on our carriage lights on both garages - set the timers and the lights go on and off every day, nice. We put up a fake Christmas tree in the big dormer above the front door - very nice (You can read about it [here](http://www.thewargos.com/2010/11/getting-ready-for-christmas/) and see a picture). I even put together this cool new lighted snowman we got for the front yard - now I just need to figure out where to put it.

Anna and picked up a new rug for the front entryway - the one we had there was very old and falling apart. The new one looks awesome and we're going to try to pick up one for different parts of the house every month until we get everything we need. I can't wait.

Time to get back to work.
