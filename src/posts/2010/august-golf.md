Elizabeth was invited to a birthday party yesterday afternoon and, since August wasn’t invited, I decided it would be a good time for the two of us to have some quality time together. I was going to say ‘he and I’ but worried that Anna would correct my grammar, she’s always doing that, so I went back and changed the phrasing.

August and Elizabeth had been bugging me to go play golf, so we decided to head over to a little Executive (Executive is a euphemism for short attention span) Golf course in a nearby town. It’s a Podunk little golf course and it’s not in very good repair, but it was enough for August. We ended up playing 6 holes. He started out being really goofy and not trying very hard, but for holes 3 through 5 he really tried and did fairly well (for a six year old). Late on 5 and all through 6 he just wasn’t paying attention, so we headed off to Sonic for dinner.

Here are some pictures of August at the course.

At one point, he’d been using his 7 iron for everything except putting so I started having him use different clubs just to get a feel for them. I noticed he had a hybrid club (kind of a mix between an iron and a wood) so I suggested he give that one a try (special thanks to Aunt Sue and Cousin Robert for the clubs by the way). He positioned himself by the ball and took a swing and the ball went further than he’d ever hit a golf ball before. It was way cool. I shouted my praise for the shot, walked over and gave him a bug high five and he hugged me and said ‘I love you dad!’ It was a great night and I can’t wait to do it again (and again and again and again…..)
