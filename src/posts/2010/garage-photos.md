As you may have heard, we're putting an extra garage in the back yard. Originally it was intended to be a workshop for me (our house doesn't have a basement, so I needed a place for my tools) but we later decided to move my office out of the bonus room into the outbuilding. The builder we hired showed us a garage that he built that we really feel exactly fits the bill for my needs. We spent some time at the other garage getting a feel for it and we loved it.

Before we hired the builder, we spoke to several customers plus the owner of the garage. The garage owner said something that really hooked us - he said that if there's ever a serious storm in the area, he's going to leave his house and hide out in his garage - he said it was so well built it could weather any storm.

Anyway, the builder was kind enough to share some pictures of the garage - this is what my new garage will look like although mine won't be brick, it will be the same as the house, grey stucco.
