OK, so of course I have an iPad and I LOVE IT.Â  I'm having some troubles with Wi-Fi connectivity and I hope Apple does something about it soon. The kids have been playing with it a lot so I've downloaded a few drawing applications for it, just so the kids have something to do. Here's a picture Elizabeth drew on it.
