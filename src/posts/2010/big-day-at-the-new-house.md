Well, we've been in the house for 8 days now and we're probably about 70% unpacked. Anna's been working like crazy getting more and more unpacked in each room. Won't be too long before we're all done.

August is SMITTEN - there's this little girl who is in his class at school and lives two doors down. He played with her after school yesterday, wrote two love letters to her this morning and put them in her mailbox (bet the postal service loves that) and spent about three hours playing with her today. I think I heard him tell her that he loved her. He certainly put that into the cards he made as well.

Last summer my gas grill exploded (I think I wrote about it). Well we decided not to fix it and threw it away before we moved. I purchased a new one today, the Consumer Reports Best Buy, and assembled it on the driveway this afternoon (in shorts mind you). It's awesome and we've already grilled out (burgers and hot dogs) tonight. It was wonderful! Â I was thinking of everyone at home in Akron dealing with even more snow while I cooked on my new grill in shorts! Life is good.

Need to spend some time tomorrow finishing unpacking my office. I should be able to finish it tomorrow and be functional for work.
