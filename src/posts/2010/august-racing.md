I played golf this morning with my neighbor and of course August wanted to go as well. I'd promised August we'd play this weekend, so we made plans to head out after Anna finished running some errands. During the day, we got out our clubs and some practice balls and spent some time hitting balls in the front yard. When it came time to go to the driving range, August decided instead that he wanted to play miniature golf. So, we trucked over to the miniature golf place and played a round.

The place also had go-karts and other activities for kids, so I purchased a ticket for August to ride on the rookie track before we started our game of golf. Here are some pictures (more of the story follows the pictures).

After our round of golf, I took August on the big kids go-karts. I drove a double seater and August sat next to me. For about the first 30 seconds of our ride, he screamed at the top of his lungs. Then he started kissing me on the shoulder - he was so happy. I'm sorry I couldn't get pictures of it, I will when I take the whole family some time in the future.
