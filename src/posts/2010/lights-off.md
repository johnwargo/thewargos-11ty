Every morning before I start work, I head over to the area of the house where the kid's bedrooms are and check to see what lights and fans were left on. This morning, every single light and fan in that entire part of the house was still on. They turn everything on in the morning when they get up. If only I could teach them to turn things off when they're done with them.
