I had a few minutes before a customer call so I headed outside to see what Anna and the kids were doing. Anna had purchased some pine straw from a wandering salesman ($4 per bundle, cash) and she was spreading them around the beds. There was a soccer ball on the ground and I told her I was going to see if I could hit the kids (who were playing about 50 yards away). I put the ball down, wound up and kicked it. It curved slightly as it made its way to August (who was riding his bike on the sidewalk). It hit the ground in front of him, bounced up and hit hit right in the middle of his chest. Nailed it!

August isn't happy about it, but at least I know I can still hit a Soccer ball.

Here are some pictured of the front beds Anna's working on.
