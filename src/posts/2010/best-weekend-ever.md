It's been an amazing weekend here. Last night we got together with two other couples to have a nice dinner at The Dish in Charlotte then headed over to the Neighborhood Theater to see Paul Thorn (www.paulthorn.com) in concert. It was amazing. Dinner was great and the concert was awesome; he puts on a great show every time.

Today August had a Soccer game at 9 then he and Elizbeth were off to a birthday party followed by another one for August this afternoon. Since Anna was with August, Elizabeth and I headed out for lunch at Steak & Shake and then off to play miniature golf and ride go-carts.

After dinner I started this ginormous squirt gun fight with the neighborhood kids. It all started when I turned on the sprinker system to try to get August wet. As he and some friends started riding their bikes through the water, I grabbed a big squirt gun and started hosing everyone down. Before you knew it, we were all across the street terrorizing our neighbors. Within about an hour, everyone was wet (including 5 adults) and we were all exhausted. Way, way fun. I LOVE this neighborhood.  We had the hose out, garbage cans full of water and little sophie had this wee tiny little squirt gun (we all had big ones); it was like bringing a knife to a gun fight.

Afterwards, some of the neighborhood kids were over and started begging Anna to allow a sleep over. She immediately said no, no, no but then when I walked upstairs, I said 'sure, why not.'  Well, hours later, they're just now getting into bed. There's four kids in August's room, we have four mattresses on the floor (after August's bed collapsed during preparations). We'll see if anyone goes to sleep. The neighborhod kids have been told they're going home if they don't sleep. August and Elizabeth were told they're going to sleep in the garage if they don't go to sleep. It won't work, but so far they're having fun. Me too!
