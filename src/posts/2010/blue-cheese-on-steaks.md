I hate it when you go to what's supposed to be a great steak restaurant and they don't know how to melt blue cheese on s steak. If the steak is almost $30 and the 'melted blue cheese' is still crumbles, you're wasting your time with this restaurant.

And, what gives with this blue cheese crust thing Outback and Flemings are doing? Yuck. Why would I want bread crumbs mixed in with my blue cheese when blue cheese all by itself is so freaking awesome? Inquiring minds want to know.
