When we were in Akron, I just couldn't get excited about Christmas. I don't know whether it was something about the house or who wasn't in the house with us, but I just stopped caring about decorating for Christmas. Now that we're in Charlotte, I decided to try to make a big deal out of the holiday (and all holidays).Â  If you've seen the pictures, the house has a series of dormers across the front. There's even one above the front door and for some reason it has a power outlet in it. So, when we bought the house, I decided that we were going to put something up in that dormer for each holiday - something that could be seen from the street and also from within the house.

We've been so busy this year that I really haven't been able to make anything happen, but for Christmas Anna picked up a 7 1/2 foot lighted (fake) Christmas tree. Friday morning, I couldn't put ANYTHING up for Christmas before Thanksgiving, I dug out the new tree and assembled it up in the dormer. It looks great from the street and from the main foyer. We even finally figured out what that last switch was for in one of the bedroom storage areas (it controlled the outlet in the dormer). Here's a picture of the twins up in the dormer with the new tree.
