August and I headed out to play golf yesterday. My back's been bothering me for a long time now and was finally getting good enough that I thought I could handle it. It was of course 100 degrees F, but we went out anyway.

Well, we made it all of 5 holes. August was just too hot and way distracted...'look, a bug' that we just couldn't play. The funniest part for me was when he'd be lining up to take a shot and, instead of looking forward to the pin, he'd look behind him. I just couldn't get him to pay attention to what he was doing.He did have some nice shots, hitting balls 20 or 30 yards. He'll get better and better over time, I can't wait to do it again.

I need to figure out what to do with the E girl. August has a set of hand me down clubs to use but Elizabeth doesn't. I don't know whether to buy her left or right handed clubs.
