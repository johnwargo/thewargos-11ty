Last fall we got a family friend to help me build a play house in the back yard for the kids. We couldn't really afford it at the time, but we had an opportunity and, since we knew we were moving south, it would give me a chance to do a learner house before building the longer lasting one in Charlotte.

So, fast forward to 2010 and our new house. Where the house in Akron had a good size yard and lots of room to play and build play sets and play houses, the new one has LOTS of yard, but no real place to put anything (too many trees). So, for this house, we decided to build a fort back in the forest out back. Anna wanted to buy a kit and build something with a built in swing and stuff, but I wanted to build something from scratch.

So, I spoke with my builder and got some design hints then Sunday Anna and I dug some holes, purchased some wood and we're going to begin building this weekend. On Sunday, we set the cornerstone - a 12 foot long post that will be the anchor of the fort. Tonight we'll put up the frame and the other posts and this weekend we'll floor it and put up some railings. Stay tuned, but I thought you'd enjoy a photo or two of this lonely post sitting in the middle of the woods.

The remaining wood for the fort should arrive within the hour.
