Anna and I were talking the other day about Christmas at the kid's school. Apparently it's against the rules to bring candy canes in to the school. Apparently some idiot decided to make [Candy Canes all about Jesus](http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/candycane.asp), so now the kids can't have them at school. Why can't a candy cane be about, I don't know, candy?Â  Why does it have to be religious? Apparently people are starting to compare snowflakes to the star Jesus was born under, so anything snowflake related will be prohibited too. You've got to be kidding me.

I was sitting with the kids and Anna this morning as they got ready for school and August asked me if I knew how many loaves and fishes he had. I had no idea what he was talking about. Anna filled me in - they're collecting food for the poor and every day the kids are bringing in canned goods and other foodstuffs. Wait a minute - why can't they have candy canes (too jesusy) but instead can do loaves and fishes? Of all of the things I've mentioned in this post, loaves and fishes are the only thing that actually are related to religion - it's a story from the Bible.

I hate parts of this politically correct and bizarre world we live in. Won't be long before cotton balls, q-tips or socks are somehow related to religion and are somehow banned from the schools. Argh!
