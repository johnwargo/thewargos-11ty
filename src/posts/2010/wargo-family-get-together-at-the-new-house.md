We had the whole Wargo Family in this weekend. It was a lot of fun, we had the 3 couples plus 5 kids all running around making a ton of noise. My brother’s family came in Friday afternoon and my sister a while later. Of course the kids were too excited to sleep, so we had a late night and two of my nephews can’t do anything but get up at 5:30 so it was … challenging.

Saturday morning Anna made pancakes and the men spent the rest of the morning taking everything out of the garage and putting it back in a more organized manner. We can now get one care in (which we’ve been able to do for a while now) and all of the bikes easily accessible with some more room for regular, everyday junk. While the men were working, the women went shopping and had a nice lunch.

Being the lazy father that I can me when I’m busy, the kids headed over to August’s girlfriend’s (yep, he’s in love) house to bounce on the trampoline. A couple of hours later (remember, I told you we were busy) I headed over to collect everyone. Apparently I’d been a bad father by letting them head over there. This family has 6 kids and they just kept the kids busy. They made brownies (never did get my hands on one) and were watching a movie when I came to get them. Apparently, and I promise I didn’t know this, you’re supposed to check with a family before you send 5 children over to play. In my defense, I thought they were going to just jump on a trampoline and someone would crack a head and I’d see them again in 15 minutes. I didn’t expect babysitting; I assumed they’d be sent back to me soon after they arrived.

Anyway, when they came home Ed and Chip setup a sandwich assembly line and the kids had lunch. When the women folk came home, the men headed over to Cook Out (http://www.cookoutnc.com/) for a quick lunch then headed out to play 9 holes of golf. It was a beautiful, sunny day and I shot a 49 – which isn’t bad considering it’s the first time I’ve played since October and the greens were in crappy shape (aerated and covered in sand).

When I came home, August and the rest of the kids were playing out back. They had our sleds out and were using them to sled down our backyard hill. No, we didn’t have snow. Soon after, they discovered they could ride down the hill on their skateboard. No children were harmed in this activity – but I know soon they’ll be upping the ante. We’ll see what goes down the hill next.
