Well, about $350 later, our camera has been fixed and I can get back to taking some good pictures of the new garage/office. While I was out of town last week, they finished framing the building, put on the roof and installed the windows. Here's some update pictures:

The plan for this week is to finish the framing and probably start on the plumbing and electrical. It's possible they'll even get started on putting up the stucco. They have a couple of errors to fix from the framing and I need to figure out how to fit a ceiling fan, four speakers and two fluorescent lights on the ceiling.Â  Could be fun.
