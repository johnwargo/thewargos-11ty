Older Ohio houses always had these low ceilings. In my parents house, we were always stuck with a 6 or 7 foot tree just because of the ceilings. In the south, we all have these great big ceilings and our den has big vaulted ceilings - something like 15 or 18 feet tall. Yesterday we went out looking for a tree and of course we had so much room to work with, we picked up a ginormous tree (like 12 feet tall). Not quite too tall for the room, it took two men to carry this tree in, but we could have gone even further if we wanted to (I didn't want too).

All of us worked together to put the lights on the tree before the twins went to bed last night. Right now they're decorating the tree - it's going to be beautiful.

Here's a picture of the tree as it was last night. Merry Christmas!
