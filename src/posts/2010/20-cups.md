My sister in law was driving home from a Family Reunion this afternoon and swung by to visit us. A little impromptu family play date, very nice. We decided to have dinner then she'd hit the road and put the kids to bed. Anna ordered pizza from Donatos and I went to pick it up.

Now, we've kinda ended up being the center of the neighborhood - not because we're so popular but because our house is right between many houses with children. Anna and I were talking this weekend about how we needed to get a whole bunch of cups to have here. The kids use them like crazy and the adults need them too.

So, as I picked up the pizza, the girl behind the counter handed me a little plastic cup full of coupons. I thought for a quick second and asked her 'can I have some more of those?'  Well, she asked me how many I wanted and I told her I'd like 10 (thinking we'd try to get 10 every time we picked up pizza and ultimately have enough some day). She grabbed a big stack and started counting out cups when I, of course, said 'Can I just have all of them?'  Well, when I got home I counted them - 20 cups.  Free advertising for Donatos (too bad we already love their pizza) and free cups for us. Win-win on both sides.

Now all I need to do is find someone who's giving away adult size cups so I can get like 50 of them. Stay tuned, I know I'll find them somewhere.
