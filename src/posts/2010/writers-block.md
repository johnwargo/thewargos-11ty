I was so traumatized by my previous employer over my business writing that toward the end (and probably one of the reasons they let me go) I just couldn't write anything. I had to write in my boss' voice and I found it just too difficult. On top of that, everything was done by committee and it was just a nightmare to accommodate everyone on top of a picky boss. The last real document I had to write took me weeks to write - I just stared and stared at the screen, completely unable to put any words down. It was horrible.

Fast forward to my new job...I have a few things to write and I find myself back in the old rut of staring at an empty page for hours again. I have no idea how my new employer is going to be about my writing. hopefully I can get past this writers block.
