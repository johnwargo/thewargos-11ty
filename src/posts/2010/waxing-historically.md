Well, it was a year ago that I was misdiagnosed by a Doctor covering for my primary provider. I went in because I felt horrible and she, after sticking a couple of fingers up my _you know what_, decided I had a prostate infection and prescribed some anti-biotics.

Right in the middle of all of this (it being three days before Christmas) we had a flurry of activity on our house. A small bidding war began, one couple offering a ridiculous amount and demanding the right to counter and another couple, the ones who first looked at the house as soon as it went on sale 8 months previously, who made a very nice and reasonable offer. The rest, as you say, was history - the house sold.

We quickly began panicking and negotiating then quickly headed down to NC to drop off the kids at my brother's and head over to Charlotte to begin looking for a house. We found the one we currently live in on the very first day. Anna walked in, looked around, and said 'this is it!'

Did I mention I was misdiagnosed? Well, through all of this it turned out I had pneumonia and swine flu. So, as we looked at houses, negotiated with the seller and dealt with the county and development architecture review board I was near death. I spent most of the week sleeping or trying to sleep. Our Realtor got real used to me just lying down and trying to sleep as we went from place to place. I was finally able to get the right diagnosis and some really cool drugs - only took me about 6 weeks to recover, just in time to move south.

Anyway, I'm happy we're here! We love the neighborhood and we love our neighbors. It's a great house, a great place to be and we're happy. I can't help thinking about how bad things were a year ago as we did all of this stuff - hence me waxing historically.
