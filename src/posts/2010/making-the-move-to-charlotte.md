Well, we finished the closing on our current house in Akron last week and spent the weekend frantically finishing the last of the packing. On Monday I headed down to Charlotte (with a full van of stuff) to close on that house. A problem with the paperwork held up the closing, but I finally got that done late yesterday and headed home.

Made it home this morning after a overnight stop in Beckley to find a moving van in the front yard being loaded. We're finishing up today and will be on the road to our new house tomorrow. Stay tuned.
