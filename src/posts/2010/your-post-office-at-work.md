Well, we’re all moved in to the house and getting ready to build a garage. We hired a builder, we have preliminary plans and I’m excited to break ground. One of the things we needed for the builder is the survey that was done on the property as part of the closing. I sent email after email to the closing lawyer asking for a copy of the survey and got no response (McMillan-Terry, they suck).

I asked the Realtor for help and she said that she had a copy of the survey she could give me. She said she’d drop it by the house that afternoon. For some bizarre reason, she said she’d put in the mailbox (rather than drop it off at the door).  I looked later in the afternoon for the envelope and couldn’t find it.  I called her and what happened was she stuffed the survey in an envelope and put it in the mail box.

At the time, I had letters in the mailbox to be picked up and the flag was up. She put it in the back of the mailbox, away from the outbound letters but still in the mailbox. Now, don’t get me wrong, we love our Realtor – but in this case, she apparently wasn’t thinking although as you’ll see it all worked out. Well, our harried mailwoman grabbed the outbound letters AND the envelop our Realtor placed there.

I called the Realtor and of course that was the only copy of the survey. Gone, it was just gone. Crikey!

Well, repeated calls to the law firm came up with nothing. I finally got someone to respond, but it’s been two weeks now and nothing’s happened.

The other day, I got an envelope in the mail. It was thick, like it had several envelopes in it. I recognized the name on the return address, but didn’t know why. As I opened it, I learned what happened to the survey my Realtor put in my mailbox.

The US Postal Service, in its infinite wisdom, got the letter – saw that it said ‘John & Anna Wargo’ on the front of it and didn’t know where to deliver it. They:

1.    Opened the letter 2.    Saw the address of the Surveyor 3.    Stuffed it in an envelope and delivered it to the surveyor!

Yep, they delivered it to the person listed inside the letter rather than the people identified on the front of the letter. I can’t imagine that there are that many John and Anna Wargo couples in Charlotte – I’ll have to take a look.

Anyway, the surveyor, being smarter than the US Postal Service apparently, opened the letter, saw it was for us and mailed it to the address listed on the survey. Long and circuitous route, but I finally got a copy of the survey. What fun.
