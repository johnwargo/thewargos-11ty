I've discovered three things that have turned out to have been the hard parts of the move to Charlotte.

## One

First of all was how freaking difficult it was to get the local newspaper to actually deliver the newspaper. In today's age where newspapers are withering away (I plan on switching all of my magazines and newspapers to electronic format once I get an Apple iPad) you'd think they'd be happy to get a new customer. I went online more than a month in advance of the move and setup an account - even specified the date I wanted the paper to start being delivered (the day after I arrived). First day? No paper. Called, was promised it would be delivered the next day. The next day? No paper. Called again - and of course they can't find my account - was promised a paper. Next day? No paper. I finally had to demand that one be brought to me and finally they started delivering it. Woohoo!

## Two

Phone dialing. I'm having the hardest time remembering to NOT dial a 1 when calling numbers in the local Charlotte area code, 704. Every freaking time I dial a local number I have to dial it twice. First when I dial it with the 1 before the area code and again when the system tells me an idiot and I don't need to dial a 1. I'm sure some day I'll get used to it, but it's been a long, long time since anything but 330 was the local area code for me.

## Three

Phone Dialing revisited. The other part of this is how hard it is to dial local Akron numbers. Of course, in the opposite of the previous paragraph, I'm having difficulty remembering to include the 1 before dialing Akron numbers.Â  Of course on the mobile phone the switch is smart enough to just ignore the 1 if I add it and don't need it or add the 1 if I dial and forget to add it. Interesting that the landline switches just aren't smart enough to do that.

## Conclusion

That's it - the hardest things so far. You'd think the move would have caused more problems than that but it really went pretty smoothly. The movers showed up on time, did what they said they'd do and didn't break anything (much). The only other problem was those idiots at Time Warner but I've [already written about that](http://www.thewargos.com/2010/02/time-warner-cable-bunch-of-idiots/).
