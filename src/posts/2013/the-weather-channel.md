Wanted to fill you in on my last tweet. I was watching the weather channel and they were showing some landslides in a particular county in NC. They showed a house on a particular road then announced (idiots) that the owner of the house is in Colorado at the moment.

I now know which county, which road and have a picture of the house plus know that the owner is out of town. Now how hard will it be for me to find the house and rob it?

Flipping idiots.
