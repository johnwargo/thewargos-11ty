I made a double batch of Rice Krispy treats today. I’m having some neighbors over tonight to play Poker and I thought I’d make something nice for them.

Now I’m quite proud of my RCTs (as I’m starting to call them). I’ve never had a commercially made RCT that’s any good and many that you get at bake sales are…good, but not fantastic. I take special care when making them and thought I’d share my secret recipe with you. Promise to keep this to yourself?

Anyway, there are just a few, simple steps you need to follow when making the best RCTs.

1. Use name brand miniature marshmallows. Store brand marshmallows are not good, has to be a name brand like Kraft or Campfire. I know they tell you that they’re the same, but they’re simply not.
2. Use butter, NOT margarine. Margarine is for sissies. Butter, real butter is the most important part of the secret. And, even though they tell you to use three tablespoons, use four – a full half stick of butter. If you feel bad about it, take an extra lap around the track at the gym and stop complaining about it.
3. Melt everything SLOWLY. You can’t make RCTs in a hurry – you have to slow down and melt things on a low heat. If it takes 20 minutes or more to make the RCTs then you’re doing OK. If you did it in 5 minutes, then simply throw them away because the melted marshmallow will be too hard when cooled.
4. Use fresh Rice Krispies. Don’t use what you have in the pantry, suck it up and go out and get a new box.

That’s it – all you need to know to make the best Rice Krispy Treats.
