We have this storage room that’s full of boxes and had these nasty wire shelves on one wall. As soon as we moved in, we yanked down most of the shelves and had less storage room than we started with. After Anna saw my work on the CD shelves (I still need to write about that project) she agreed to let me make storage shelves for this storage room.

I purchased a bunch of plywood and cut it all up then Anna and I spent most of the weekend painting everything. I wouldn’t have painted it, it’s storage room shelving, doesn’t need to look pretty. Anyway, it’s all painted and ready to go.

Today I made some final cuts on the sides and moved them into the room (I’m going to have to assemble in place because of space constraints). Tonight I drilled all of the pocket holes on the shelves. This weekend (probably Saturday morning) I’m going to assemble them and put them into place.

I’m using the Kreg Pocket Hole Jig for these shelves – it is an amazing tool and way, way easy to use. Delivers a great joint between wood pieces. What’s cool about the way I’ve done this is that for the CD shelves and now these shelves, I have everything cut and ready to simply assemble. As one of our friends who helped me assemble the CD shelves – it’s like an Ikea product: a big stack of wood and a bunch of parts to connect them all together.

I’ll take a bunch of pictures and show you what we did when it’s all done.
