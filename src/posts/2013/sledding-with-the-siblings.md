We spent this weekend with my siblings in the NC mountains. On Sunday, we headed over to Maggie Valley to do some tubing in the snow, but the place was sold out until 8 PM. We bagged that idea. We decided to take the scenic route home and drove a few miles before turning off onto the Blue Ridge Parkway. Because of the recent snow, the parkway was closed, but a bunch of cars had pulled over and there were a lot of people hiking and enjoying the snow.

As we parked our cars (it took two cars to transport the 12 of us) we noticed a bunch of people sledding. There wasn't much snow, but some kids (and adults) were making the best of it. Of course, I had two sleds in the back of the van, so we all played on the hill for a couple of hours. My brother in law brought beers and Anna found a bottle of wine in the car, so we made a party of it. Everyone was drinking (but me) and we opened up the car and blasted tunes for everyone (Chicago's greatest hits - my mom would have love it). We got a passer by to take the photo you see at the top of the post.

Had a great time with the siblings and all of our kids - can't wait to do it again.
