When the twins were born, I immediately set them up with email accounts on this site. When they got their tablets earlier this year, I was able to set them up with those email accounts on the device. I also set them up with web sites; August's is augustwargo.com and Elizabeth's is lisawargo.com. August and I spent some time a while back working on his and this afternoon Lizzie and I spent some time working on hers.

August seems to think that you have to be logged in to view the site. Hopefully Elizabeth won't think the same. Not much up there, but I imagine over the next 10 years or so those sites get some use. We'll see what happens.
