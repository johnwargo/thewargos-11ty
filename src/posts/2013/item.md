A while back, my brother in law gave me the item shown in the figure below. I’ll let you take a look at it for a minute before I tell you what it is.

{% image "src/images/2013/f-bomb.png", "Image of an F-bomb", "image-full" %}

As soon as he handed it to me, he asked me ‘do you know what this is?’ Of course it did, it’s an F-bomb. Get it?

Anyways, what’s funny about this and the reason for me writing this article is that a quick survey has shown me that some people get this instantly but others simply can’t make the connection. Apparently my BOL asked my brother and he had no clue, his PhD wife walked by and said “that’s an F-bomb.” My wife looked at it and couldn’t figure out what it was and, once she learned what it was, immediately said “I don’t think of a hand-grenade as a bomb” I don’t know what else it could be, but OK.

I tweeted a picture of this last week after I hung it and when I saw one of my neighbors, a very smart neighbor, she immediately said “I give up” – she couldn’t figure it out. Another neighbor walked up and she got it within 2 seconds.

I guess it’s all about how your brain is wired (and perhaps how dirty your mind is).
