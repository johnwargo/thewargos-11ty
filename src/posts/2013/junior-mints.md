My kids know I love Junior Mints. Whenever they’re in a store and see them that grab a box and hold them up for me to see. On Halloween, any time they get some in their bags, they pull them out and give them to me. Pretty cool stuff.

Santa knows I love them too; he gives them to me in my stocking every Christmas. The problem is that when I have some, I tend to eat them – right away. I almost wish he wouldn’t give me any…NOT!

I love them so much that I even bought a Junior Mints Lunch Box at Disney one time (I’ve been there like 18 times). It’s sitting on my shelves in my office.
