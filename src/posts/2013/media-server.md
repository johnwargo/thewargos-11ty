We finally have access to my music collection in the house. Both CD players we had broke and my fancy new receiver wasn't able to pull music off of my windows server. Learned about the Plex media server installed it and finally got it working today. Sooooo cool to pick an artist or a CD and play it - without having to grab the disc.

I am going to see if I can get this working from Apple TV next.
