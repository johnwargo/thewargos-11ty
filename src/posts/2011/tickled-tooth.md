Elizabeth's been losing some teeth lately. She fell a while back and whacked two of her front teeth and they started to wiggle. On Sunday, she was getting out of her church dress when I walked into the room. She had her dress pulled over her head with her belly exposed. Of course I couldn't pass up the opportunity to give her a big belly tickle. She screamed, pulled her hands down and promptly knocked one of her loose teeth out of her mouth.

I'd tickled her tooth right out of her mouth.

Of course, the tooth wasn't really ready to come out yet, so there was a lot of screaming and blood. Anna soothed her while I laughed uncontrollably. I got some very serious dirty looks from her (Elizabeth) as she cried in her mom's lap. Anna doesn't really give me dirty looks, but Elizabeth's got a good one. I pity her future boyfriends and husband.
