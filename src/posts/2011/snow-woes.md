We've had a really fun week. We had a big snow storm on Monday (3 - 4 inches of snow, big for Charlotte) and the kids were out of school. They had a blast playing in the snow with their friends and made a real big day of it.

Monday night, rain came in and they cancelled school again for Tuesday - can't go to school when the roads are covered in ice. Yet another day of sliding and sledding around with their friends.

Last night they cancelled school again (for today). Temperatures in the 20's made it so any ice that melted yesterday (no snow trucks here) froze again. Not sure what the kids are going to do today, but I imagine it's sledding and sliding around with their friends again.

The only issue I have so far is that Anna keeps making chocolate milk for the kids and has not once brought any to me. That's downright unfair.

Anyway, this weather is killing me in another way. It's not because I don't want/like snow, this has been beautiful and reminded me of Akron in December. Nope, what's bothering me is that I started building a new desktop PC (the old one was almost 5 years old) and I've been waiting on some additional parts so I can finish the build and start using the new system. Some of the parts were on a truck Monday, ready to be delivered then pulled because of the weather. Other parts should have been delivered yesterday, but no dice. My computing happiness is sitting in warehouses mere miles away and I can't get my hands on them. Ouch!

Hopefully things will clear up tomorrow and stuff will start moving again - I wonder how long it will take UPS to catch up?
