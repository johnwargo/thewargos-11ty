The other night, the kids were supposed to be in bed and I was sitting on the couch downstairs watching the Simpsons. The den has this huge vaulted ceiling and it's open upstairs right by the kid's rooms. It sucks for watching action films or something you actually want to hear any night, but what can you do?Â  I told Anna that I want to close the opening with Glass Block - she is of course not in agreement.

Anyway, during the show, some sophisticated orchestral music was playing and all of a sudden this little head popped up over the balcony. It was August and he said 'Was that Mozart?'
