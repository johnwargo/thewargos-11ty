I’m getting ready to start writing my next (third) book. As I mentioned before, I’ve been having conversations with my publisher about what I’m going to do next and I think we’ve decided on the topic.  I’m waiting on a contract from my publisher then I’ll get started.

In the mean time, I decided to register a domain and open up a site where I can list information about my different books. Additionally, there’s another John Wargo writing books so I have to have a way to distinguish my books from his.  I brought the site up this weekend, it’s called John Wargo Books and it can be found at [www.johnwargobooks.com](http://www.johnwargobooks.com "John Wargo Books"). Check it out when you get a chance and be sure to tell your friends!
