I moved my tools and my office into my new man cave back in October. I've been trying to get all of my tools unboxed so I can start doing some of the projects I wanted to do around here and it's just been a struggle. Back during the holidays I decided to put some cabinets in the back of the new garage so I can store my tools in them. I started looking at cabinets on sale at Home Depot, but they really didn't suit my needs. My brother in law Ed suggested a few things and one of them was to put a space between the cabinets for larger equipment. It was a great idea.

Rather than buy something, I decided to get some help, buy the wood and build them myself. I got the wood a couple of weeks ago and put them together. I finally got them installed last week and I'm mostly moved in. I thought I'd share some pictures of the shelves. I think they turned out pretty well (if I do say myself).

That funky stuff you see on the floor is the crappy epoxy coating the builder put down. We're waiting for warmer weather for them to pull it all up and put something else down in its place.
